# Software development basics

You've made it to this repository, great! The following are some steps to help you get started in the world of software development. If you already have some stuff installed or are already familiar with certain concepts, feel free to skip them, of course :)


## Step 1 - COMMAND LINE
1. Learn about what the command line is and what it does:   
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line
2. Decide on which command line you want to use for your system (differences between mac/windows/linux) and install/run it
3. Play around with simple command line commands to make sure you can navigate through your computer's folder structure via the command line, and create a new folder where you will place your future coding projects

## Step 2 - GITHUB
1. Create a github account, if you don't already have one
2. Learn about basic git commands and play around in a playground:

   https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=de_DE
3. Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, using the command line or the github desktop application or something similar

## Step 3 - IDE (code editor)
1. Install an IDE to work with code on your computer. Current Recommendation: VS Code   
   https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Open the repository you cloned in your IDE

## Step 4 - HTML / CSS
1. Learn/revise HTML and CSS basics. There are many excellent different resources online, for example:          
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/
2. Optional: get better acquainted with flexbox, a useful CSS layout system by reading about the basics and training with flexbox froggy:

3. PROJECT: Create a branch in your forked repository and build a simple website using only HTML and CSS where you introduce yourself (name, hobbies, future aspirations etc) if you haven't already done a similar project before; try to build it without following an example, coming up with your own design and layout. It doesn't have to look professional - the purpose of this exercise is for you to freely try out different concepts you've learned

## Step 5 - JAVASCRIPT
1. Learn/revise JS basics, with one of the many options available online, for example:    
   https://www.jshero.net/home.html
2. Optional: deep dive into JS, and have a detailed look at some of the more advanced concepts of JS, such as closures, recursion and asynchroneous javascript. Recommended Youtube Playlist:

4. PROJECT: Create a branch and build a simple page with a memory app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are many good tutorials out there, such as:    
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4&t=1254s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified   
   Follow along with the tutorial to create your own game, and make sure to add your personal flavor to the game by using different images, sounds, changing the animation etc
