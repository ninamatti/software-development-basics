# Software development basics (work in progress)

You've made it to this repository, great! The following are some steps to help you get started in the world of software development. If you already have some stuff installed or are already familiar with certain concepts, feel free to skip them, of course :)


# PART 1 - BASICS

## Step 1 - COMMAND LINE
1. Learn about what the command line is and what it does:   
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line
2. Decide on which command line you want to use for your system (differences between mac/windows/linux) and install/run it
3. Play around with simple command line commands to make sure you can navigate through your computer's folder structure via the command line, and create a new folder where you will place your future coding projects

## Step 2 - GITHUB
1. Create a github account, if you don't already have one
2. Learn about basic git commands and play around in a playground:    
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-the-basics/    
   https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=de_DE
3. Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine, using the command line or the github desktop application or something similar

## Step 3 - IDE (code editor)
1. Install an IDE to work with code on your computer. Current Recommendation: VS Code   
   https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Open the repository you cloned in your IDE

## Step 4 - HTML / CSS
1. Learn/revise HTML and CSS basics. There are many excellent different resources online, for example:          
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/      
   https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/  
   Test your CSS selector skills here:     
   https://flukeout.github.io/
2. Get better acquainted with flexbox, a useful CSS layout system by reading about the basics and training with flexbox froggy:    
   https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/   
   https://flexboxfroggy.com/#de     
3. PROJECT: Create a branch in your forked repository and build a simple website using only HTML and CSS where you introduce yourself (name, hobbies, future aspirations etc) if you haven't already done a similar project before; try to build it without following an example, coming up with your own design and layout. It doesn't have to look professional - the purpose of this exercise is for you to freely try out different concepts you've learned

## Step 5 - JAVASCRIPT
1. Learn/revise JS basics, with one of the many options available online, for example:    
   https://www.jshero.net/home.html
2. Deep dive into JS, and have a detailed look at some of the more advanced concepts of JS, such as closures, recursion and asynchroneous javascript. Recommended Youtube Playlist:    
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84
4. PROJECT: Create a branch and build a simple page with a memory app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are many good tutorials out there, such as:    
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4&t=1254s&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified   
   Follow along with the tutorial to create your own game, and make sure to add your personal flavor to the game by using different images, sounds, changing the animation etc   
5. Optional: Host your memory card game on Codepen - sign up, create a new "Pen" and insert your html/css/js code in the respective space, and share your work with your friends if you want :)  
   https://codepen.io/

## Step 6 - THE DOM
1. Learn about debugging in the Browser:  (TODO: insert this step into the JS steps)  
   https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome
2. Learn about the DOM and how to access and manipulate html elements:   
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dom-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-document-object-model/
3. Learn about form validation:   
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/form-validation-with-html5-and-javascript/
5. PROJECT: to train using query selectors and input validation, add a button to your Website that generates sharks when clicked!    
   In detail:   
   3.1 Create a button that says "Unleash sharks" and below it a text input field.     
   3.2 Below the input field, create a blue box that has a width of 300px but doesn't have a set height.  
   3.3 If the user types a number into the text input field and pushes the button, the blue box should be populated with that many shark emojisðŸ¦ˆ. If the user does not enter a number (no input or non-numerical input), do not generate any sharks but generate a short text anywhere around the button to let the user know that their input was incorrect.      
   3.4 All the styling should be managed in the CSS file.   

## Step 7 - APIs
1. Learn about what APIs are (feel free to search the internet for more information):    
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction
2. Learn about basic CRUD operations and REST APIs:        
   https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud
3. Learn about the Fetch API (only looking at basic fetch requests is necessary, but feel free to go into depth if you want):   
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch  
4. Review the concepts of Arrays and the use of map and filter methods to return specific data:    
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-map-reduce-and-filter-explained-with-examples/    
5. PROJECT: Get familiar with and fetch Pokemon Data from the PokeAPI with a simple FETCH request, and display some of its information in whatever way you like on your website (For example, Display the first five Pokemon you get back from their pokemon database with an image, their name and one of their attacks). Make sure not to make too many requests while testing since this creates server costs for the hosts!     
   https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon.     
6. Learn about how to use Postman to make requests and test your API calls:     
   https://www.toolsqa.com/postman/postman-tutorial/
8. PROJECT: Create your own REST API that provides some kind of simple data (for example, a list of your favourite books or games etc) when a GET request comes in, and also accepts other CRUD operations to change data. Test it with Postman.
